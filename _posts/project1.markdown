I was a member of a group that worked on an Object Tracking project. The object was a red ball, and using a webcam and OpenCV, the ball was tracked. This information was passed onto a servo motor. Depending on the motion of the ball, the servo motor moved accordingly.

Skills involved in the project:
<ul>
      <li> OpenCV </li>
      <li> Python </li>
     
    </ul>
