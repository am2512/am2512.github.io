For the final project of ME 314: Theory of Machine Dynamics, we had to simulate dynamics of a system in Mathematica. I chose to simulate a person doing a backward somersault on a trampoline.

Skills involved in the project:
<ul>
      <li> Mathematica </li>
      <li> Knowledge of Lagrangian Dynamics </li>
     
    </ul>
